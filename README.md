I have finished with all the functionalities.
But I must clarify a few things.
  1- I found an improvement in the directions description. The description said that i must do two api calls, but when i readed the apis calls,
  they were the same, then i decided do one only api call and with the response, do the tasks, for better performance of the app.
  for that reason, you will can find one api call in viewmodel.
  2- If these two api call were neccesary, I would just add another api call in the view model and do the differents tasks with the response.
  3- Thank so much, and sorry if i did something wrong with my modifications.
